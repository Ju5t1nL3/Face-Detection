# Face Detection

This program takes an image and draws blue rectangles around each face in the image. To run the program, download FaceDetection.py file and the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml into the same folder. Afterwards, download the image you want to use in the same folder and change line 9 from 'image.jpg' to whatever the file name of the new image is. Then, simply run the code! The file will save in the same folder as face_detected.jpg and a window will automatically pop up. To exit, simply press any key on your keyboard.
